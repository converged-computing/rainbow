This is a prototype that will use a Go [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) server/client to demonstrate multi-cluster scheduling.

## TODO

- satifies
 - the function needs to actually do DFS (look at what fluxion does) and then address each resource
 - add print statements to debug checks at different levels / types
- clusters
 - implement function to add a subsystem to an existing cluster (e.g., add I/O)
- subsystems
  - a satisfies request will need to have a representation of subsystems. E.g., what are we asking of each?
    - right now we assume a node resouces request going to the dominant subsystem
  - we will want a function to add a new subsystem, right now we have one dominant for nodes
  - make also a function to delete subsystems
- we can have top level metrics for quick assessment if cluster is OK
- subsystems should allow for multiple (with keys) and references across to dominant subsystem
- is there a way to unify into one graph?
- (advanced) request jobs should accept way to filter or specify criteria for request
- ephemeral case - actual nodes don't exist, but instead rules for requests and limits. Need to develop this and means to authenticate to use it.
